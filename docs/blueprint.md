## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated sky blue (#47A7FF) to represent clarity, trustworthiness, and financial insight. 
- Background color: Very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, provides a clean and uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: Slightly darker, cooler blue (#4682B4) to highlight key interactive elements and call-to-action buttons, contrasting with the background to draw attention without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, known for its readability and modern appearance.
- Use flat, minimalist icons in a single accent color to represent different categories, actions, and information, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Employ a card-based layout for the product list, the checkout summary, and the budget management section to organize content clearly.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., fade-ins, progress bar updates) to provide feedback to user actions and enhance the overall experience without distracting from the app's core functionality.
